# ImageCaptionGenrator
This project aims to generate natural language captions for images using a combination of VGG19 and LSTM networks. VGG19 is utilized to extract feature vectors from images, while LSTM networks are employed for model training and evaluation. The project involves preprocessing captions using natural language processing techniques, including tokenization and removal of noise and punctuation. For detailed instructions and code, please refer to the attached Jupyter notebook. Additionally, you can find the dataset used for training and evaluation at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityajn105/flickr8k
